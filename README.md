# Planetary Simulation

## About the Project
An interactive simulation of the inner solar system based on [Tech with Tim's tutorial](https://youtu.be/WTLPmUHTPqo?si=HZWzYnVGoaiFFwDX), extended with a range of new features, including enhanced visuals and new celestial bodies.

Followed the initial phase of the project through this Tech with Tim tutorial (i.e. planet setup, planet gravitational pull, pygame interface)


## Features
- Realistic planetary physics using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
- Moons with orbit mechanics around their associated planet (Earth & Mars)
- Orbit path visualization
- Rotating Sprites that simulate the light from the Sun
- Adjustable Simulation Speed that ranges from 0.5x to 3x
- Zoom-in Camera accessed by either clicking the body or pressing through 1-9 on the keyboard
- Names of the planets/moons shown when zoomed in (press h to activate/deactivate)
