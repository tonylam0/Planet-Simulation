# Planetary Simulation

## About the Project
An interactive simulation of the inner solar system based on [Tech with Tim's tutorial](https://youtu.be/WTLPmUHTPqo?si=HZWzYnVGoaiFFwDX), extended with a range of new features, including enhanced visuals and new celestial bodies.



## Features
- Realistic planetary physics using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
- Moons with orbit mechanics around their associated planet (Earth & Mars)
- Orbit path visualization
- Rotating Sprites that simulate the light from the Sun
- Adjustable Simulation Speed that ranges from 0.5x to 3x
- Zoom-in Camera centered around a celestial body
    - Click the celestial body to zoom
    - Press keys through `1-9` to zoom
- Names of the planets/moons shown when zoomed in 
    - Press `H` to activate/deactivate
